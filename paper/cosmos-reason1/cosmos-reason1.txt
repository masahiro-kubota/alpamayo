Embodied Reasoning

arXiv:2503.15558v3 [cs.AI] 19 May 2025

Abstract
Physical AI systems need to perceive, understand, and perform complex actions in the physical world.
In this paper, we present the Cosmos-Reason1 models that can understand the physical world and
generate appropriate embodied decisions (e.g., next step action) in natural language through long
chain-of-thought reasoning processes. We begin by defining key capabilities for Physical AI reasoning,
with a focus on physical common sense and embodied reasoning. To represent physical common sense,
we use a hierarchical ontology that captures fundamental knowledge about space, time, and physics. For
embodied reasoning, we rely on a two-dimensional ontology that generalizes across different physical
embodiments. Building on these capabilities, we develop two multimodal large language models, CosmosReason1-7B and Cosmos-Reason1-56B. We curate data and train our models in two stages: Physical AI
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Physical AI reinforcement learning (RL). To evaluate our models, we
build comprehensive benchmarks for physical common sense and embodied reasoning according to our
ontologies. Evaluation results show that Physical AI SFT and RL bring significant improvements. To
facilitate the development of Physical AI, we make our code and pre-trained models available under the
NVIDIA Open Model License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1.

1. Introduction
Physical AI systems are designed to interact with the physical world. To effectively follow instructions and take
appropriate actions to achieve a desired goal, they need first to perceive, understand, and reason about the
physical world. Recently, with breakthroughs of post-training and test-time scaling via long chain-of-thought
(CoT) processes, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general reasoning capabilities
in tackling complex problems across domains such as coding and mathematics (OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI,
2025). However, a key limitation of these models lies in their ability to ground their knowledge in the physical
world. While LLMs trained on vast amounts of textual data from the Internet may acquire essential knowledge
to reason about the physical world, they often struggle to establish connections between that knowledge and
real-world interactions and dynamics.
In this paper, we begin by defining the fundamental capabilities essential for Physical AI systems. Unlike
designing models that excel at solving coding and mathematical problems, our focus is on empowering
models with physical common sense knowledge and embodied reasoning capabilities grounded in the real
world. To establish a shared framework and help measure progress, we propose two ontologies. First, a
hierarchical ontology that organizes physical common sense into three major categories — Space, Time,
and Fundamental Physics — which are further divided into 16 fine-grained subcategories. This ontology
encapsulates knowledge about how the physical world operates under the laws of physics and how it responds
to interactions with embodied agents. Second, we introduce a two-dimensional ontology for embodied
reasoning, which encompasses four key reasoning capabilities across five types of embodied agents. Effective
embodied reasoning based on physical common sense is crucial for understanding and planning actions that
achieve specific objectives in the real world. The details are described in Sec. 2.

Figure 1: An overview of Cosmos-Reason1. Cosmos-Reason1 contains two multimodal large language models of
7B and 56B, trained in two stages, including Physical AI SFT and Physical AI RL. We also define two ontologies
for physical common sense and embodied reasoning, and build two benchmarks to evaluate models’ Physical
AI reasoning capabilities.
We introduce Cosmos-Reason1 as a step toward enabling multimodal LLMs to generate more physically grounded
responses. We focus on the visual world, where the observations of the world are represented as videos.
Cosmos-Reason1 perceives the physical world through video input, understands it, and reasons about it through
long chain-of-thought thinking processes before generating responses. These responses, expressed in natural
language, include both explanatory insights and embodied decisions, such as determining the next action
to take. We employ a decoder-only multimodal LLM architecture where the input video is processed by a
vision encoder followed by a projector to align with the text token embeddings before feeding into the LLM.
We experiment with both dense Transformer and hybrid Mamba-MLP-Transformer architecture as the LLM
backbone. Cosmos-Reason1 comes with two model sizes: Cosmos-Reason1-7B and Cosmos-Reason1-56B. We
describe details about the model architecture in Sec. 3.
Constructing rule-based, verifiable rewards at scale has been critical for the reasoning LLMs’ success in solving
math and coding problems. Can we design rule-based, verifiable rewards for training Physical AI reasoning
models with reinforcement learning? In this work, we explore two types of rewards based on answering
multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The first type of MCQs are designed based on human annotations. With
inspiration from video self-supervised learning, we automatically generate a second type of MCQ based on the
structure of video data itself, such as solving puzzles with shuffled spatiotemporal video patches or predicting
the arrow of time on whether a video is playing forward or backward. All these rewards are rule-based,
verifiable, and highly relevant to Physical AI capabilities. We discuss details about the design of RL training
algorithm and infrastructure in Sec. 4.
Data determines our model’s ceiling. To strengthen our models’ physical common sense and embodied reasoning
capabilities, we carefully curate around 4M annotations of video and text pairs, including captions for physical
understanding, multiple choice questions, and long chain-of-thought reasoning traces. We develop two pipelines
to curate these physical common sense and embodied reasoning data according to our ontologies. The data
are curated based on human annotations and model distillation from DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025) for
Physical AI supervised fine-tuning. Details about data are discussed in Sec. 5.
In order to evaluate our models, we build new benchmarks for evaluating Physical AI capabilities in Sec. 6.
For physical common sense in Sec. 6.1, we build three benchmarks (Space, Time, and Fundamental Physics)
containing 604 questions from 426 videos. For embodied reasoning in Sec. 6.2, we build six benchmarks

Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning

containing 610 questions from 600 videos, covering a wide range of tasks across different physical embodiments,
including humans, robot arms, humanoid robots, and autonomous vehicles.
Sec. 7 presents the evaluation results of Cosmos-Reason1 and comparisons with existing models. In Sec. 7.1,
we introduce the experiment setup, including training details for Physical AI SFT, and evaluation results of SFT
models on our benchmarks. In Sec. 7.2, we present the evaluation results for Physical AI RL. Training using our
rule-based, verifiable rewards in RL post-training leads to improvements in all of our benchmarks.
Fig. 1 shows an overview of Cosmos-Reason1. In summary, we introduce two multimodal large language
models, Cosmos-Reason1-7B and Cosmos-Reason1-56B. The models are trained in two stages: Physical AI
SFT and Physical AI RL. We define ontologies for physical common sense and embodied reasoning and
build benchmarks to evaluate models’ Physical AI reasoning capabilities. To facilitate the advancement of
Physical AI, we make our code and pre-trained models available under the NVIDIA Open Model License at
https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1. Building reasoning models for Physical AI is an open
problem that is far from being solved, and we hope our paper contributes to the advancement of this field.

2. Physical AI Reasoning
We identify two important capabilities for Physical AI reasoning models — physical common sense reasoning
and embodied reasoning. First, Physical AI models should possess physical common sense, meaning a general,
embodiment-agnostic understanding of the environment and forms the basis for predicting what is plausible
and implausible in the real world. Second, Physical AI models should also help embodied agents perceive,
reason, and make decisions about planning future interactions with the physical environment. We seek to
incorporate both “System 1” and “System 2” in physical common sense reasoning and embodied reasoning.
“System 1” enables fast, intuitive responses such as pattern recognition and instinctive judgments, while “System
2” operates more slowly, engaging in deliberate reasoning for complex decision-making (Kahneman, 2011).

2.1. Common Sense Reasoning
Humans acquire physical common sense primarily through passive observation of the world. For example,
infants can understand basic concepts such as object permanence and gravity in a few months after birth (Riochet
et al., 2021). This common sense encompasses a collection of knowledge about what is possible, impossible, or
likely to happen in the real world. Training AI systems in real-world environments is expensive and can pose
risks to both the system and its surroundings. Utilizing physical common sense, AI systems can quickly learn
new skills with minimal trial and error while avoiding making critical mistakes in uncertain scenarios (LeCun,
2022).
To define physical common sense, we introduce an ontology comprising three broad categories: Space, Time,
and other Fundamental Physics, further divided into 16 fine-grained subcategories. Inspired by Morris et al.
(2024), we focus on capabilities rather than processes. Specifically, our ontology identifies key capabilities that
Physical AI models should possess, without specifying the mechanisms or embodiments by which a system
accomplishes tasks. For example, we believe the ability to understand the spatial relationship of objects, the
temporal order of events, and object permanence are fundamental to Physical AI. However, such systems need
not necessarily act human-like, such as grasping with dexterous hands with fingers or walking on two legs.
We show our physical common sense ontology in Fig. 2. The Space category encompasses the relationships
between objects, their interactions, and the surrounding environment. It includes concepts such as Relationship,
Plausibility, Accordance, and Environment. The Time category pertains to actions and events that unfold over a
duration, covering Actions, Order, Causality, Camera, and Planning. Lastly, we introduce a Fundamental Physics
category to address objects and core physical principles, including Attributes, States, Object Permanence,
Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, and Anti-Physics. Detailed definitions of all subcategories are
described in Tab. 1.

Time, and Fundamental Physics) and 16 fine-grained subcategories.

2.2. Embodied Reasoning
Physical AI operates in the real world, where environments are dynamic, uncertain, and governed by complex
physical interactions. Unlike abstract reasoning in mathematics and programming, which manipulates symbols
in a structured and deterministic manner, embodied reasoning requires an AI system to interact with and learn
from the physical world. Unlike passive understanding, reasoning in embodied AI is often grounded in action,
enabling robots not only to comprehend what they currently observe but also plan intelligent behaviors for the
future in uncertain and dynamic environments. Specifically, embodied reasoning requires the capability to:
1. Process Complex Sensory Inputs. Unlike symbolic reasoning, which works with clean data representations, embodied reasoning must extract meaningful patterns from raw, often incomplete, and ambiguous
sensory inputs.
2. Predict Action Effects. Actions have physical consequences, and effective reasoning requires an intuitive
grasp of cause-and-effect relationships. An AI system must predict how an object will respond to force,
how a robot’s body will interact with its surroundings, or how a vehicle’s movement will be influenced by
terrain and physics.
3. Respect Physical Constraints. Unlike abstract problem-solving, which often involves optimizing discrete
choices, embodied reasoning must account for real-world physics, such as inertia, friction, and material
properties. It requires AI to generate long-horizon action plans that are feasible given physical constraints,
ensuring stability, efficiency, and safety in execution.
4. Learn from Interaction. In Physical AI, actions do not occur in isolation; every movement or decision
affects the environment and generates feedback. Embodied reasoning must continuously update its
understanding based on these interactions, allowing the system to refine its behavior dynamically.
Embodied reasoning is also not confined to a single type of agent — it is applicable to humans, animals, and
robots across various forms (e.g., robotic arms, humanoid figures, or autonomous vehicles). They all need to
develop similar embodied reasoning skills to navigate, manipulate, and make adaptive decisions under different
environmental conditions and task goals. We summarize capabilities and types of physical embodiments with
examples into a two-dimensional ontology in Tab. 2.

In this paper, we focus on the first three embodied reasoning capabilities we defined above and leave “Learn
from Interactions” as future work. Specifically, we focus on video input as a representative example of “Process
Complex Sensory Inputs”. For “Predict Action Effects”, we focus on two tasks, including task-completion
verification for determining whether a task has been completed, and the next plausible action prediction
for predicting the next plausible next action to achieve a goal. For “Respect Physical Constraints”, we focus
on action affordance to assess whether it is possible to perform a specific action toward a goal. We collect
videos across different agents, including humans, robot arms, humanoid robots, and autonomous vehicles. By
investigating these varied cases, we aim to deepen our understanding of how embodied reasoning enables
intelligent interaction with the physical world.

Cosmos-Reason1 is a family of multimodal large language models specialized in Physical AI reasoning. The
family comprises two models: Cosmos-Reason1-7B and Cosmos-Reason1-56B. In this section, we introduce the
design of our multimodal architectures and the choices of LLM backbones.

3.1. Multimodal Architecture
There are different architecture designs for building multimodal large language models (LLMs) using existing
text-only LLM backbones and vision encoders. Commonly used architectures are the decoder-only architecture
(e.g., LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023)) and the cross-attention-based architecture (e.g., Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022)
and Llama 3-V (Grattafiori et al., 2024)). We utilize the decoder-only architecture similar to LLaVA (Liu et al.,
2023) and NVLM-D (Dai et al., 2024) for its simplicity and unified handling of all modalities by aligning other
modality tokens (image or video) into the text token embedding space. Specifically, the model begins with the
vision encoder (Chen et al., 2024), followed by the projector containing a downsampling two-layer MLP, and
then the decoder-only LLM backbone (Nvidia et al., 2024; Waleffe et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI, 2025).
For Cosmos-Reason1-7B, we choose Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025) as our pre-trained model and follow the
same image and video processing. For Cosmos-Reason1-56B, we leverage InternViT-300M-V2.5 (Chen et al.,
2024) as our vision encoder and Nemotron-H (NVIDIA, 2025) as our LLM backbone. We perform the following
processing for the Cosmos-Reason1-56B hybrid model. For each input image, we dynamically adjust the image
to a predefined aspect ratio and segment it into 1 to 12 tiles, each measuring 448 × 448 pixels, depending on
the image’s resolution. Additionally, we generate a thumbnail tile; a scaled-down version of the full image to
preserve the global context. More details can be found in Dai et al. (2024). For each input video, we uniformly
sample up to 32 frames at a maximum rate of 2 frames per second, resizing each frame to 448 × 448 pixels.
For each 448 × 448 video frame input, the vision encoder generates 1,024 visual tokens with the patch size of
14 × 14, which are then downsampled by a factor of 2 × 2 using PixelShuffle (Shi et al., 2016), reducing them to
256 tokens by transforming spatial dimensions into channel dimensions. The image tokens from multiple tiles
are concatenated with interleaved tile ID tags, as described in Dai et al. (2024), while the video tokens from
multiple frames are concatenated directly. More discussions about the hybrid LLM backbone are in Sec. 3.2.
We illustrate our hybrid multimodal architecture in Fig. 3 and summarize our model configurations in Tab. 3.

3.2. Hybrid Mamba-MLP-Transformer Backbone
Since its introduction, the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) has revolutionized the field of
language modeling, becoming the de facto standard for building foundation models. However, its self-attention
mechanism has a quadratic time complexity with respect to its context length. In contrast, the recently proposed
Mamba architecture (Gu and Dao, 2023) introduces linear-time sequence modeling with selective state space

responses with long chain-of-thought reasoning processes.

models, making it significantly more efficient for handling long sequences. In practice, the selective state spaces
of Mamba may not be sufficient to capture every detail within long sequences. To address this, a small portion of
Transformer layers is incorporated for long-context modeling, giving rise to the hybrid Mamba-MLP-Transformer
architecture (Waleffe et al., 2024).

Alternating Mamba-MLP module on top of the figure.

In Cosmos-Reason1-56B, we use a pre-trained model with a hybrid Mamba-MLP-Transformer architecture (NVIDIA,
2025) as our backbone. An illustration of the 56B LLM architectures can be found in Fig. 4. We train the
Cosmos-Reason1-7B dense model with a Tensor Parallelism of 4 (TP=4) (Shoeybi et al., 2019), while the
Cosmos-Reason1-56B hybrid model is trained with a Tensor Parallelism of 8 and a Pipeline Parallelism of 2
(TP=8, PP=2).

4. Reinforcement Learning
We employ two training stages, Physical AI SFT and Physical AI RL, to adapt a pre-trained visual language
model (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025) or Nemotron-H-VLM (NVIDIA, 2025)) to a Physical AI reasoning
model. After the SFT stage, we post-train our models using RL with Physical AI focused tasks to further enhance
their physics common sense and embodied reasoning abilities. In this section, we explain the algorithm and
the customized training framework, which highly efficient and robust for RL training.

4.1. Algorithm
We adopt GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as our RL algorithm of choice for its simplicity and computational efficiency,
as it circumvents the necessity of training and maintaining a separate critic model. GRPO enables a streamlined
approach to policy optimization, wherein the advantage function is derived by normalizing rewards within a
cohort of responses generated for each prompt. Let 𝑅(𝑜𝑖 ) denotes the reward for response 𝑜𝑖 , in a group of
responses 𝒢 = {𝑜1 , 𝑜2 , . . . , 𝑜𝐺 }, then the computed advantage can be expressed as:
𝐴𝑖 =

𝑅(𝑜𝑖 ) − mean(𝒢)
std(𝒢)

4.2. Training Framework
To make more efficient use of RL training data, we also propose a novel, fully asynchronous and highly robust
RL training framework. The architecture is shown in Fig. 5. First, unlike mainstream colocated frameworks (Hu
et al., 2024; Sheng et al., 2024) that suffer from inefficient resource utilization due to synchronization overhead,
the proposed framework adopts a heterogeneous deployment strategy for policy training and actor rollout. By
leveraging a unified dispatcher to schedule and dispatch training prompts, our design enables asynchronous
parallelism across the entire training pipeline. This achieves end-to-end asynchrony while maintaining training
effectiveness, resulting in approximately a 160% improvement in training efficiency compared with the colocated
frameworks. Second, attributed to our novelly designed training mesh management logic, the framework is
able to rapidly reconfigure itself and continue the current training step even if any node fails during training,
without requiring costly restarts or recovery procedures. Furthermore, the dispatcher redundancy mechanism

Figure 5: The architecture of the proposed RL training framework. There are mainly three parts of the
framework. (1) Dispatcher: schedule and distribute training data, manage the status of the framework. (2)
Actor Rollout: generate responses from the prompt, compute rewards and advantages for the policy training.
(3) Policy Training: conduct an RL algorithm on the actor and optimize the actor based on the rewards and
other constraints. The policy training nodes support 5D-parallelism, i.e. data parallel (DP), pipeline parallel
(PP), context parallel (CP), fully-sharded data parallel (FSDP), and tensor parallel (TP). The actor rollout nodes
support DP, PP, and TP. We adopt a customized NCCL communicator to communicate between the dispatcher
and the rollout/policy node.

also improves overall framework robustness, and the fault-tolerant design inherently supports dynamic scaling,
both up and down, enabling flexible resource allocation based on workload demands.

5. Data
In this section, we explain the data sources and their curation procedure of Physical AI SFT and RL for training
Cosmos-Reason1 models.

5.1. Physical AI Supervised Fine-Tuning
In this stage, we fine-tune models from the previous phase on domain-specific data to specialize in Physical
AI. This process aims to achieve two key outcomes: (1) enhance the model’s vision-language capabilities on
Physical AI-specific data and (2) develop two critical reasoning abilities — physical common sense reasoning
and embodied reasoning (detailed in Sec. 2.1 and Sec. 2.2). Unlike the previous two training stages, existing
data sources cannot be directly utilized for Physical AI SFT. To address this challenge, we develop a specialized
pipeline to carefully curate SFT datasets for both physical common sense and embodied reasoning applications.
A portion of the Physical AI SFT data, particularly visual question-answering (VQA) pairs, are generated through
a model-in-the-loop approach rather than directly from human curation.
For physical common sense, we build VQA datasets to answer free-form and multiple-choice questions from
videos. For embodied reasoning, we subsample and convert existing datasets into our SFT datasets, where we
cover a wide range of tasks across different embodiments, including humans, robot arms, humanoid robots, and
autonomous vehicles. For each dataset, we collect two types of annotations: understanding and reasoning.
An understanding annotation contains the video’s question and answer for common sense and a detailed
description of states and actions in the video (a structured video caption). A reasoning annotation contains a

9

Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning

long chain-of-thought (CoT) thinking trace for the given text prompt and an input video. Additionally, we further
curate specific reasoning SFT datasets to enhance our models’ ablitity to understand spatiotemporal visual
stimuli (through puzzles and arrow of time in videos) as well as object permanence (through phyiscs-based
simulation). These datasets are collectively referred to as intuitive physics. Tab. 4 summarizes the datasets we
used for Physical AI SFT and Fig. 6 shows examples of video frames from the Physical AI SFT datasets. Next,
we describe the setting-specific curation pipelines in detail.

Figure 6: Example of video frames from our Physical AI supervised fine-tuning datasets.
5.1.1. Physical Common Sense SFT
As stated earlier, for physical common sense, we collect VQA datasets that consist of both free-form and
multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Our curation pipeline for physical common sense data consists of five stages:
1. Human-in-the-loop Video Curation. We curate a set of high-quality videos based on human preferences.
We extract short clips from these videos and use them as training samples.
2. Detailed Captioning. We employ either reliable human annotators or pre-trained vision-language models
(VLMs) to extract detailed descriptions of videos. These serve as “captions” which we use to construct
understanding and reasoning annotations for video clips.
3. Curating QA Pairs. We prompt an LLM to construct free-form or multiple-choice questions based on the
detailed clip descriptions. We construct two kinds of questions: (1) “understanding” questions that cover
the content in the video (as observed through the captions) and (2) hypothetical “reasoning” questions
that require information from the caption for constructing the question but cannot be answered directly
based on the detailed caption. The “reasoning” questions require more thought beyond just perceiving
the events and objects in the clip. Our reasoning questions focus on common sense reasoning, spatial
reasoning, and temporal reasoning from videos. Prompt A.1 shows a sample question-construction prompt
template used to produce reasoning questions.
4. Extracting Reasoning Traces. To obtain complete “reasoning” annotations, we prompt a DeepSeekR1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025) to answer the reasoning subset of questions by using the detailed caption as
context. Then, we parse DeepSeek-R1’s response into a thinking trace and an answer. We find it is

important to ask questions that cannot be directly answered from the caption. Otherwise, R1 can directly
retrieve the answer from the provided caption, making the thinking trace invalid for model training.
Our “reasoning” annotations consist of the reasoning questions, corresponding clips, thinking traces, and
answers. Prompt A.2 shows a sample prompt used to elicit reasoning from DeepSeek-R1.
5. Cleaning & Rewriting. Finally, we employ a rule-based cleaning and rewriting stage for the “reasoning”
annotations to produce valid SFT samples. Since we compress the visual context of the clip into text,
rewriting helps remove unwanted references such as “description” or “caption” in the SFT training
samples.
Using the aforementioned pipeline, we curated physical common sense VQA datasets consisting of both free-form
and multiple-choice questions, with a few additional considerations as outlined below:
Free-form Questions: We used 9.9K videos from the curated set of “high-quality” clips and obtained corresponding detailed descriptions annotated by humans. The average length of human-annotated captions is
297.4 ± 46.4 words. For free-form questions, we obtain ∼99k understanding SFT samples and ∼59.4k reasoning
SFT samples through the pipeline described above.
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs): To ensure our model is capable of answering multiple-choice questions
(MCQs), we additionally collect a set of “understanding” and “reasoning” MCQs for the high-quality curated
clips. Unlike the free-form questions, we first annotate the set of ∼1.2M high-quality clips with detailed captions
from a VLM. Using these captions, we construct ∼2.4M “understanding” MCQs. Then, we take a subset of
∼356k clips and use the detailed captions to produce ∼600k “reasoning MCQs”.

Figure 7: Embodied reasoning SFT data curation pipeline. We demonstrate an illustrative example for AgiBot,
where we (1) extract short horizon segments corresponding to the subtask, (2) caption the extracted clip to
obtain state-action context, (3) curate QA pairs for “next plausible subtask prediction”, (4) prompt R1 with the
question and caption to elicit reasoning, (5) clean and rewrite the reasoning trace to obtain valid SFT samples.
Our embodied reasoning SFT data-curation pipeline focuses on three key properties essential for decisionmaking in Physical AI agents: (1) “task-completion verification”: the ability to determine whether a task or
subtask has been successfully completed; (2) “action affordance”: the ability to assess whether executing a
specific action or making progress toward a goal is possible; and (3) “next plausible action prediction”: the
ability to identify the most plausible next action or subtask to advance toward a specified goal. These properties

11

Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning

are fundamental for effective decision-making across various embodiments and task configurations. To develop
these reasoning capabilities, we curate SFT samples from both public and proprietary datasets. The embodied
reasoning SFT dataset we use contains structured entries with four components: visual captions, questions,
corresponding answers, and detailed reasoning traces.
Videos demonstrating Physical AI agents pursuing goal-oriented tasks serve as our primary source of embodied
reasoning data. We collect SFT data from sources featuring demonstrations of humans, robots, or vehicles
executing specific tasks. For embodied reasoning, we focus specifically on short-horizon reasoning related to
our key properties of interest — determining whether an agent can reason about an immediate next subtask or
action given a goal (affordance and next plausible action prediction), or evaluate the successful completion of
short-horizon tasks (verifying task-completion). Since existing Physical AI demonstration datasets may lack the
dense annotations needed to extract such localized action or subtask sequences, we use a series of specialized
steps to extract such segments. We ensure our curated dataset is rich in terms of diversity, short-horizon
granularity (immediate next action or immediate next subtask), embodiments and reasoning prompts. The
curation pipeline we use has the following general steps (also illustrated in Fig. 7):
1. Extracting Short-Horizon Segments. Since we are interested in short-horizon reasoning tasks, we break
down long video demonstrations into concise clips focused on short-horizon reasoning tasks. These
segments capture either individual actions (e.g., “move left”) or distinct subtasks (e.g., “open fridge
door”). When existing datasets already provide appropriately segmented clips or timestamps, we utilize
them directly. Otherwise, we leverage complementary annotations such as action primitives and plans to
extract these short-horizon segments.
2. Annotating State-Action Context. For every short-horizon clip, we use a VLM to produce structured
captions that detail the present objects, their attributes and associated actions. When datasets provide
supplementary annotations that can enhance the quality of such structured captions, we incorporate
this information into the VLM prompt. These constitute our “understanding” annotations for embodied
reasoning SFT. For AV data, we directly use human-annotated captions.
3. Curating Reasoning QA Pairs. We develop reasoning question-answer pairs focusing on our key properties
of interest, based on available subtask and action annotations. For datasets already containing suitable
QA pairs addressing our target properties, we apply minimal rule-based preprocessing before adding
them to our pool of embodied reasoning SFT data.
4. Extracting Reasoning Traces. We utilize DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025) to generate reasoning
traces for our curated QA pairs. Since R1 lacks visual processing capabilities, we construct prompts
containing the state-action context, question, and additional information (such as subtask instructions or
overall goals) to elicit appropriate reasoning traces. Fig. 7 demonstrates this process, while Prompt A.3
shows an example user prompt that transforms visual information into textual context for a short-horizon
question about “next plausible action”.
5. Cleaning & Rewriting. Finally, we use rule-based cleaning and rewriting to retain only valid and useful
reasoning traces. Since we compress the visual context of the clip into text, rewriting helps remove
unwanted references to the “description” or “caption”.
The exact specifics of each step in the curation pipeline vary slightly across datasets, but the overall pipeline
remains the same. We now describe how this pipeline is applied across the individual data sources.
BridgeData V2: BridgeData V2 (Walke et al., 2023) is designed to advance scalable robot learning by providing
a wide array of robotic manipulation behaviors. The dataset emphasizes foundational object manipulation
tasks such as pick-and-place, pushing, and sweeping, alongside more complex activities like stacking blocks
and folding cloths. It comprises 60,096 trajectories, including 50,365 teleoperated demonstrations and 9,731
scripted pick-and-place rollouts, spanning 13 distinct skills across 24 diverse environments. Each trajectory
is annotated with natural language instructions corresponding to the task performed by the robot. The
environments are categorized into four groups (toy kitchens, tabletops, toy sinks, and other), with a significant

12

Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning

portion of the data collected from seven unique toy kitchens featuring combinations of sinks, stoves, and
microwaves. We first split the videos from the dataset “train” split and obtain 129.5K video clips. Then we use
a VLM to caption the video clips as the understanding annotations. In the captioning prompt, we also provide
additional information such as detected objects and action sequences from ECoT (Zawalski et al., 2024). We
produce only “next plausible action prediction” reasoning QA pairs for BridgeData V2, where the answers
correspond to action primitives such as move left. The reasoning annotations are generated by feeding the
captions and questions to DeepSeek-R1.
RoboVQA: RoboVQA (Sermanet et al., 2024) is a large-scale robotics-focused visual question answering dataset.
It consists of videos, instructions, and question-answer pairs of agents (robots, humans, humans-with-graspingtools) executing a task. RoboVQA has 6 different question-types that cover aspects related to planning, verifying
task-completion, discriminative affordance, generative affordance, past description and future prediction (these
correspond to properties outlined before). We directly use the clips in RoboVQA without any clipping to obtain
a dataset of ∼220k clips. We caption these clips using the VLM and extract reasoning traces from DeepSeek-R1
by combining the task-context, caption and question into a suitable user prompt. This leads to ∼930k QA pairs
with reasoning traces. We filter a suitable subset post-cleaning and use the clips & QA pairs in the “train” split
of the dataset for SFT. SFT samples from RoboVQA encompass all the 3 desired properties in our embodied
reasoning curation pipeline.
AgiBot: AgiBot World (AgiBot, 2024) is a high-fidelity robot manipulation dataset. The data is collected using
the AgiBot G1 hardware platform, covering a wide range of real-life tasks. It consists of 36 tasks. Each task
contains multiple episodes that vary in terms of environment and objects. We subsample a portion of episodes
for each task, resulting in a total of 3,300 videos. Each video is annotated with overall task information and
multiple subtask annotations, including start and end frames. We utilize these action annotations to split the
videos into clips, resulting in a final dataset of 19.8K clips. These clips are captioned by the VLM to convert
the visual information to the scene/object descriptions and their movements. We produce only “next plausible
subtask prediction” questions for AgiBot, where the answer corresponds to a subtask (“place cucumber in the
bag”). Then we use DeepSeek-R1 to reason about the next possible subtask required to complete the task,
based on the generated captions.
HoloAssist: Egocentric datasets capture crucial first-person perspectives that provide natural and immersive
understanding of human actions, but present unique challenges including camera motion, subtle movements,
occlusions, out-of-view objects, spatial perspective issues, and the need for global scene comprehension. Despite
these challenges, they remain valuable for developing embodied decision-making capabilities in Physical AI
systems, potentially enabling human-like interpretation and response to real-world environments. We choose
to build upon HoloAssist (Wang et al., 2023), which contains 166 hours of egocentric video focused on objectcentric manipulation tasks. Notably, HoloAssist uniquely includes human mistakes and the corrective steps
taken to fix them. These insights can help Physical AI learn in a way that mirrors how humans learn and
refine their understanding with objects in the real world. Using timestamped coarse- and fine-grained action
annotations from HoloAssist, we split 1,758 videos into a final dataset of 139,653 clips. We employ a VLM to
generate caption annotations. We produce only “next plausible subtask prediction” questions for HoloAssist,
where the answer corresponds to a subtask. We use DeepSeek-R1 to produce reasoning traces for predicting the
next possible subtasks needed to complete a task based on the generated captions. In each pipeline, we provide
the task annotation as the overall goal and the fine-grained annotation as the current subtask to supplement
captioning.
Autonomous Vehicles (AV): As a key domain in Physical AI, autonomous vehicles (AV) rely on large-scale and
high-quality data to enable safe and reliable self-driving experiences, particularly in the era of rapidly scaling
end-to-end systems. In this work, to avoid captioning hallucinations — especially in subtle behaviors and
complex interactions — we utilize proprietary datasets with high-quality captions annotated by humans. Our
dataset consists of ∼12.4K videos, each 20 seconds long, totaling around 70 hours. Each caption includes three

13

Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning

categories: (1) general description, which details ego behaviors, environmental conditions (e.g., scene type,
time of day, weather, road conditions), and critical objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, traffic lights,
traffic signs); (2) driving difficulty, which provides a concise assessment of driving complexity based on the
level of driver attention required and the scenario’s uniqueness or risk; and (3) notice, which highlights notable
events, such as signs and signals, road user interactions, and abnormal behaviors. By leveraging these captions,
we transform driving videos into structured descriptions. DeepSeek-R1 is then used to generate reasoning
traces to predict the next most likely immediate action the ego vehicle will be taking based on these structured
descriptions.
5.1.3. Intuitive Physics SFT: Spatial Puzzles, Arrow-of-Time and Object Permanence
While the prior SFT stages enable domain-specific reasoning for Physical AI applications, we incorporate
additional SFT stages to develop fundamental reasoning abilities centered around intuitive physics. Although
intuitive physics reasoning capabilities encompass a broad taxonomy (see Tab. 1), we focus specifically on three
key aspects: reasoning about spatial continuity (through spatial puzzles), reasoning about the arrow of time
(through the temporal order of events in videos), and reasoning about objectness (through simulation-based
settings that assess object permanence). These tasks are inherently self-supervised by construction, which
simplifies the data curation process. Despite significant progress in more sophisticated tasks, current state-ofthe-art VLMs still underperform substantially on these simpler fundamental reasoning objectives. To address
these limitations, we curate specialized SFT datasets targeting spatial continuity, arrow of time, and object
permanence.
Reasoning about Spatial Continuity: Spatial Puzzles. In addition to spatial relationships, understanding
spatial continuity is crucial for Physical AI tasks. To imbue our models with a fundamental understanding of
spatial continuity, we further finetune them on a task of solving spatial puzzles. Specifically, we curate 3000
videos featuring diverse backgrounds, motions, and camera poses. For each video, we extract the first frame
and divide it into 2×2 patches. These patches are then shuffled to create a new clip, where one frame is
one patch. We prompt the model to identify the left, top, bottom, and right positions relative to the original
frame. To further increase the complexity of the task, we introduce seven additional distractor images, each
also divided into 2×2 patches. This results in a total of 32 shuffled frames for a single sample, which are
provided to the model to reason about the correct positions. Additionally, we design a few “identity”-driven
supplementary tasks — determining which two or three frames originate from the same image as the first
frame. Akin to contrastive learning, this task requires models to develop strong spatial reasoning capabilities
while distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant samples, except now with reasoning.
To generate high-quality reasoning data for spatial continuity, we first caption each of the 32 patches using a
VLM and input these descriptions into DeepSeek-R1 to solve one of the three tasks. We only retain samples
where R1 makes the correct prediction. Each of the 3,000 images is processed multiple times with varying
distractors and shuffle orders. After filtering, our final dataset consists of 11k videos. Prompt A.4 shows a
sample prompt to elicit reasoning traces.
Reasoning about Time: Arrow-of-Time (AoT). Similar to space, we also imbue our models with the ability
to reason about time, specifically the temporal order of events in a macroscopic scale. We want our model to
understand that time is inherently irreversible at a macroscopic scale, and the same can be perceived through
motion and activity patterns in videos. Being able to reason about the one-way arrow of time is crucial for
Physical AI, as it is closely linked to fundamental physical phenomena such as entropy, gravity, and causality.
Additionally, it can serve as a proxy supervisory signal for learning intuitive physics. In particular, temporally
altered or reversed videos contain physics-defying artifacts that a Physical AI capable reasoning model should
be able to evaluate.
We construct an SFT dataset containing 30,000 short video clips and their reversed versions using a subset of
videos from the training dataset of Cosmos-Predict1 (NVIDIA, 2025). This subset features videos containing

14

Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning

diverse and complex tasks that frequently involve significant motion. We prioritize videos with large motion, as
they serve as the most representative examples for distinguishing the arrow of time. Unlike the prior stages, we
use a VLM to directly extract a reasoning trace for both forward and reverse playback clips. We found that
applying the same procedure as Sec. 5.1.2 led to suboptimal results for thinking trace extraction using R1. To
improve curation, we explicitly indicate whether the video is played forward or in reverse in the user prompt,
helping the VLM generate more reasonable justifications. Additionally, we carefully design the prompts to
ensure that reasoning traces maintain a consistent style and length for both playback directions. Prompt. A.5
shows an example prompt template used for this purpose. To encourage diversity in the reasoning, we curate
two distinct reasoning traces for each forward and backward video.
Reasoning about Objectness: Object Permanence. While spatial continuity and temporal order provide
foundations for understanding physical relationships and sequences, object permanence — the understanding
that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be directly observed — represents a critical reasoning
capability that is fundamental for Physical AI agents. Without strong object permanence reasoning, VLMs would
struggle with even basic real-world scenarios where objects frequently move in and out of view or become
occluded, severely limiting their utility in Physical AI applications that require consistent object tracking and
prediction capabilities.
For object permanence, we construct an SFT dataset containing 10K clips synthesized by a robot simulation
platform, Libero (Liu et al., 2023). Libero offers 130 robot arm object manipulation tasks across diverse
environments, desktop objects and pre-recorded arm action sequences. To enhance scene diversity, we
randomly sample setups from these tasks and apply object permutation and perturbation. The camera is
positioned to face the table center and orbits around the scene by selecting a random start and end point on
a sphere. During playback of the pre-recorded arm actions, the camera smoothly interpolates from the start
to the end point before returning near its starting position. Throughout this transition, some objects may be
temporarily occluded, and once fully occluded, certain objects may be randomly removed from the scene. We
prompt the model with appropriate context and ask it to analyze each clip and determine whether any objects
disappear unexpectedly, violating object permanence. To ensure the model generates reasoning traces that
consistently lead to the correct answer, we include hints in the prompt to indicate which objects disappear
and do not reappear. However, in the final SFT dataset, these hints are removed from the prompts. For object
permanence, we find that the standard pipeline of compressing visual context into captions is suboptimal for
extracting useful reasoning traces for SFT. To address this, we extract thinking traces from an intermediate
version of Cosmos-Reason1-7B. Prompt A.6 shows a sample prompt used to elicit a reasoning trace from
Cosmos-Reason1-7B.

While fine-tuning establishes foundational physical common-sense and embodied reasoning capabilities, we
further enhance these abilities through reinforcement learning post-training. This approach requires effective
reward mechanisms, which we implement using tried-and-tested rule-based and verifiable rewards following
DeepSeek-AI (2025). Unlike LLM domains such as mathematics and coding — where correct answers and
formats are precisely defined — physical common sense and embodied reasoning typically involve free-form,
open-ended responses that complicate reward assignment.
To address this challenge, we convert samples from our reasoning SFT data sources (excluding thinking traces)
into multiple-choice questions with single correct answers (see Table. 5 for the number of samples). This

15

Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning

transformation inherently enables simple, rule-based verification of responses. Our RL post-training dataset
incorporates samples from all Physical AI SFT data sources, with certain subsets — specifically Spatial Puzzles,
AoT, and Object Permanence data — already existing in binary question format, making them directly suitable
as MCQs without modification. We manually verify the quality of samples used for RL post-training. We detail
the specific characteristic of individual data sources below:
Physical Common Sense RL Data. We collect 5133 human annotated binary and multiple-choice questions
from 1989 videos. To help control the difficulty of the questions, we use the annotated questions to evaluate
four models including GPT-4o, Gemini Flason 2.0, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and our Cosmos-Reason1-7B model. Based
on the evaluation results, we further divided the collected data into two subsets: (1) the easy subset with
questions that all models got them correct; (2) the hard subset with questions that at least one model got them
wrong.
Embodied Reasoning RL Data. We select 200-250 SFT samples from each embodied reasoning data source and
convert them to multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To ensure high-quality RL post-training, we carefully verify
that these samples are free from answer and instruction ambiguity while maintaining balanced distribution
across MCQ options to prevent potential reward hacking. This process requires some manual intervention,
particularly for non-binary questions where we must select appropriate distractor options that are plausible yet
clearly incorrect. The human-in-the-loop is required to ensure question quality, making it difficult to generate
large-scale MCQ data for training.
Intuitive Physics RL Data. As previously described, our self-supervised intuitive physics SFT data naturally
exists in MCQ format by design, making it scalable to generate diverse questions. For these tasks, we implement
additional quality assurance measures to ensure balanced option distributions across all samples. We carefully
avoid any overlap with clips used during SFT to prevent early saturation during RL post-training. For the RL
post-training phase, we curate 24079 high-quality samples across spatial continuity, arrow of time, and object
permanence tasks.

6. Benchmark
We compare our trained models with other counterparts on a benchmark geared specifically towards measuring
reasoning capabilities about physical common sense, embodied decision-making. In this section, we discuss the
procedure of building our common sense and embodied reasoning benchmarks (Tab. 6). We evaluate models
by asking either binary yes / no questions or multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on video context. We
note that our benchmarks necessitate reasoning by construction (to arrive at the correct answer) and we only
measure the accuracy of the final answer. We leave quantitatively assessing the quality of the thinking trace for
future work.

6.1. Physical Common Sense Reasoning
We construct a physical common sense reasoning benchmark by manually curating questions about internet
video clips according to the ontology defined in Sec. 2.1. We initially collected a pool of 5737 questions,
including 2828 binary questions and 2909 multiple-choice questions. Fig. 8 shows the distribution of question
categories according to our ontology. After that, we went through a manual process to carefully select a subset
of 604 questions from 426 video clips used as our physical common sense benchmark, from which 336 are

binary questions and 268 are multiple choice questions. Among the 604 questions, 80 (13.25%) are about

evaluation benchmark.

6.2. Embodied Reasoning
Similar to our SFT data-curation pipeline for embodied reasoning, we constrain our embodied reasoning
benchmark to focus on the previously outlined properties before — (1) “task-completion verification”: the
ability to determine whether a task or subtask has been successfully completed; (2) “action affordance”: the
ability to assess whether executing a specific action or making progress toward a goal is possible; and (3) “next
plausible action prediction”: the ability to identify the most plausible next action or subtask to advance toward
a specified goal. We present our embodied reasoning benchmark samples as multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
to enable automatic evaluation across models. We adopt a few key steps to ensure our benchmark is useful for
measuring embodied reasoning abilities.
1. Unified Question Templates. We adopt a unified format for question formulation to ensure that reasoning
is conditioned on visual input rather than textual cues. This approach also helps align action granularity
and reduce ambiguity across different datasets.
2. Unified Action Granularity. We pay special attention to action granularity. In predicting the next
immediate action, multiple choices could be potentially correct. For example, the action “water the plant”
may involve steps such as “grab the watering can”, “move the watering can”, and “pour the watering
can”. However, these steps can also be broken down into finer sub-actions like “move left” or “tilt down”.
To address this complexity, we use a hierarchy of actions (Belkhale et al., 2024): we define atomic-level
actions as “actions”, more coarse-grained actions as “subtasks”, and dataset-specific tasks as “goals”.
3. Manual Refinement. Apart from these systemic approaches to addressing ambiguity, we also manually
refine the MCQ choices. These modifications help resolve overly similar options, enforce visual reasoning
by preventing answers from being inferred solely from text, and emphasize the full context of the entire
clip rather than just the earlier frames.
RoboVQA: We sample 101 clips from the “val” split (excluded from SFT training) of the processed RoboVQA
samples for our benchmark. For benchmarking purposes, we only consider clips and question-answer pairs

17

Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning

that correspond to ether verifying task-completion (whether a provided instruction was followed successfully)
or affordance (whether it is possible to follow an instruction / complete a task). These are included as
multiple-choice yes / no questions.
RoboFail: In addition to RoboVQA, we also manually curate and annotate 100 examples from the RoboFail (Liu
et al., 2023) dataset to create a harder “action affordance” and “task completion verification” evaluation split,
where the hardness of samples is dictated by (1) the necessity of highly observant perception or comprehensive
temporal context processing, (2) identifying physical constraints blocking follow-through for an action (unlike
RoboVQA where it’s impossible to complete an action due to perception mismatches or irrelevant instructions)
and (3) being able to reason about nuanced questions.
BridgeData V2: We split the videos from “val” split of BridgeData V2 into clips following the same way as
the training set. Then we sample 100 clips to create 100 multiple-choice QA pairs as the benchmark. In each
question, we provide the task that the robot gripper is instructed to perform in the clip, and ask what the most
plausible next immediate action is given what the robot has done in the video.
AgiBot: We sample 100 clips from the processed AgiBot SFT data to generate 100 multiple-choice QA pairs.
For each clip, we additionally provide the task information and ask which of the given subtasks is the most
likely next subtask the robot should work towards. We randomly sample the choices from the subtask sequence
of the clip’s entire trajectory. Notably, these trajectories are excluded from the training set.
HoloAssist: We sample 100 clips from the processed HoloAssist SFT data to generate 100 multiple-choice
QA pairs. For each clip, we additionally provide the coarse-grained action annotation as the overall goal and
ask which of the given subtasks is the most likely next subtask. We randomly sample the choices from other
fine-grained action annotations under that coarse-grained action. All 34 videos (out of a total of 1758) that
contain these clips are excluded from the training set to prevent episode leakage.
AV: We curate 100 videos from the proprietary data to construct 100 multiple-choice QA pairs. These videos
exhibit diverse lateral and longitudinal behaviors, along with rich interactions. The questions are designed to
(1) predict the next immediate action the ego vehicle will most likely be taking, (2) verify the completion of
a previously executed action, and (3) assess the possibility of a specific action in a given scenario. Note that
these samples in the benchmark are excluded from the training set.

7. Experiments
In this section, we illustrate the experiment setup for physical AI supervised fine-tuning and physical AI
reinforcement learning of Cosmos-Reason1 and discuss the evaluation results on our benchmarks.

7.1. Physical AI Supervised Fine-Tuning
We train Cosmos-Reason1-7B for 12.5𝐾 iterations with a cosine annealing learning rate decaying from 1 × 10−5
to 1 × 10−6 . We train Cosmos-Reason1-56B for 30𝐾 iterations with a learning rate of 1 × 10−5 , followed by 20𝐾
iterations with a decayed learning rate of 1 × 10−6 . We use a global batch size of 256 for Cosmos-Reason1-7B
and 32 for Cosmos-Reason1-56B. The fused Adam optimizer with 𝛽1 , 𝛽2 = (0.9, 0.95) and weight decay of
0.1. We follow a balanced data sampling strategy during training so that no specific domain of interest is
overrepresented during SFT. Unless stated otherwise, for our models, we report the average accuracy of 5
inferences (temperature 0.6 and top-p 0.95) with different random seeds. For evaluating other models, we
employ a zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting (Kojima et al., 2022) by either calling their APIs (GPT-4o,
OpenAI o1, Gemini 2.0 Flash) or using their open-sourced model checkpoints (Qwen2.5-VL).

7.1.3. Intuitive Physics Results
Although VLMs are often perceived as specialists achieving superhuman performance, our study reveals that
many struggle with basic physics reasoning. To test the model’s capacity to understand intuitive physics, we
curate 100 videos for each of the three tasks: the arrow of time, spatial puzzle, and object permanence, and
generate 100 questions following pipeline in Sec. 5.1.3. We conduct data decontamination to ensure no overlap
with the training data. We evaluate model performance on the curated test set.
Tab. 10 shows that the existing models struggle to perform above chance level on arrow of time and object
permanence tasks. Notably, GPT-4o and OpenAI o1 handle spatial puzzles much better than random guessing.
This observation suggests that current multimodal models are more proficient at reasoning about spatial
relationships than temporal dynamics. Given that these models generally perform well on standard benchmarks
like MMMU, this suggests that existing evaluations fail to capture their understanding of the physical world.
However, our curated intuitive physics dataset enables the 7B model to improve significantly across all three
tasks, demonstrating Cosmos-Reason1’s fundamental capability to reason in intuitive physics.

7.2. Physical AI Reinforcement Learning
We post-train Cosmos-Reason1 with simple, rule-based verifiable rewards to further enhance their Physical
AI reasoning abilities. We summarize our experimental findings on physical common sense, embodied and
intuitive physics reasoning tasks.

19

Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning

7.2.1. Experiment Setup
We adopt two types of rule-based rewards to optimize our model towards accurate reasoning of Physical AI:
1. An accuracy reward evaluates whether the model’s response, enclosed within the <answer></answer>
tags, matches the ground truth. Since we exclusively use MCQs for RL, this verification can be performed
simply through string matching.
2. A format reward encourages the model to encapsulate the thinking process in the <think></think>
tag, and the answer in the <answer></answer> tag. This is implemented as a regular expression
matching.
During training, we sample from each RL dataset with equal probability, ensuring balanced representation
across different domains. We also dynamically shuffle the MCQ choices on-the-fly to encourage generalization.
We use a global batch size of 128 questions, for each question we sample 9 outputs, each with a maximum
length cutoff of 6144 tokens. We set the learning rate to 4 × 10−6 , the coefficient of the KL penalty term to
0.005, and train the model for 500 iterations.

7.2.2. Physical Common Sense and Embodied Reasoning Results
For physical common sense and embodied reasoning, we find that Physical AI RL post-training improves
performance across most benchmark components, with the notable exception of RoboFail. The results are
summarized in Tab. 9. Performance on RoboFail remains consistently challenging through both SFT and RL
stages. This is unsurprising given RoboFail’s deliberate design as a hand-curated benchmark featuring difficult
real-world scenarios testing “action affordance” and “task-completion verification”. The benchmark’s difficulty
stems from several factors: (1) samples requiring highly observant perception or comprehensive temporal
context processing, and (2) affordance questions involving complex physical constraints in action execution,
unlike those in RoboVQA.
We attribute the stagnant performance on RoboFail primarily to insufficient representative training data. This
hypothesis is supported by examining the specific error patterns in both finetuned and post-trained models,
which include: inadequate reasoning about complex affordance scenarios, failure to be sufficiently observant of
crucial visual details, and overthinking when encountering nuanced out-of-distribution questions. We believe
targeted training on similar representative samples would significantly improve performance on this challenging
benchmark. We deliberately maintain RoboFail in our evaluation suite as a valuable indicator of areas requiring
further development in embodied reasoning capabilities.

Based on the ego vehicle's actions in the video, what is the most likely immediate action it will
take next?
A: turn right, B: turn left, C: change to right lane, D: change to left lane

Re spon se Be f or e R L
Okay, let's break this down. The video shows the ego vehicle is driving on a single-lane road
with a 25 mph speed limit. The road has parked cars on the right, so the driver is maintaining a
safe distance there. The left side is a two-way divider with oncoming traffic, which is coming
from the left in the video.
Since the road is single-lane, changing lanes (right or left) might not be possible. But the
video shows a single-lane road, which usually means one lane in each direction, so there's no
shoulder to the right for parking, but parked cars are already on the right. Maybe the road is a
single lane each way, but parked cars are on the right side of that lane. So the driver is in the
correct lane, just keeping a safe distance from the parked cars. The oncoming traffic is in the
opposite lane, so the driver is staying in their lane. Changing to the left lane would be into
oncoming traffic. So that's not possible. Therefore, the answer must be D.

Re spon se A f t e r R L
Okay, let's break this down. The user provided a driving scenario and asked for the most likely
immediate action based on the ego vehicle's current actions. First, I need to recall the details
given. The ego vehicle is on a narrow, two-way residential street with parked cars on both sides.
The driver is maintaining a steady speed, staying in their lane, and being cautious because
there's oncoming traffic in the opposite lane. The speed limit is 25 mph. The parked cars limit
visibility, so they have to be extra careful. The road markings are double yellow lines, meaning
no passing, so lane changes aren't allowed. The driver is keeping a consistent pace and staying
vigilant.
Now, the question is about predicting the next immediate action. The options are turning right,
left, changing to the right lane, or left lane. Let's consider each option.
Option A: Turn right. The video shows a two-way street. The road is narrow with parked cars on
both sides, so turning right might not be possible.
Option B: Turn left. Similar reasoning as A. Unless there's a left turn ahead, but the video
doesn't indicate any upcoming intersections or turns.
Option C: Change to right lane. The current lane is the right one since it's a two-way street.
Changing to the right lane again doesn't make sense because there's already parked cars on both
sides. So this option is probably not correct.
Option D: Change to left lane. Wait, but in a two-way street with double yellow lines, there's no
left lane to change into. The driver is in their respective lane (right for their direction), and
the opposite lane is for oncoming traffic. So changing to the left lane would be into oncoming
traffic, which is dangerous and not allowed. So this option doesn't fit either.
Wait, maybe the question is a trick. The video shows the road markings are double yellow lines,
which means no passing, so changing lanes is prohibited. Therefore, the driver cannot change
lanes, so options C and D are impossible. The only remaining options are turning right or left.
But since the video doesn't show any turns, and the driver is maintaining their path, perhaps the
answer is that none of the options are correct, but since we have to choose, I have no choice but
to select none. Therefore, the answer is none.

Figure 9: Intriguing results before and after RL. When presented with an ambiguous question, we observe that
after RL, our model learns to reject all provided options based on its knowledge.

21

Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning

Interestingly, we found that through RL, our model learns to carefully evaluate the provided choices and reject
them all if the question is ambiguous. As shown in Fig. 9, the model assesses the feasibility of each choice and
adopts a conservative action that is not within the choices when ambiguity arises.
7.2.3. Intuitive Physics Results
Similar to self-supervised learning, a key advantage of intuitive physics is the ease of data scaling. Generating
training data for the arrow of time requires only simple video reversal, spatial puzzles can be applied to any
image to create challenging spatial continuity problems, and object permanence can be easily implemented
in any simulated environment. Moreover, these data sources can be seamlessly adapted for RL training with
verifiable rewards. With this recipe, we manage to create a larger RL dataset compared to common sense and
embodied reasoning tasks with minimal human effort.
Tab. 10 shows that with careful SFT data curation and targeted training, Cosmos-Reason1-7B achieves significant
improvements across all tasks, while Physical AI RL is able to further enhance spatial puzzle and object
permanence capabilities. However, reasoning about the arrow of time still remains a challenge.
Through Physical AI RL, we found that the model further develops reasoning in space, time and object
permanence. Fig. 10 illustrates the differences in how Cosmos-Reason1 reasons about time before and after
RL. The model can identify anti-physics motions — e.g. powder defying gravity to rise into the bowl — while
remaining unaffected by stationary distractors in the video. This demonstrates that its reasoning extends beyond
mere perception. Similarly, in Fig. 11, models without RL tend to conflate spatial questions with temporal
reasoning. While they can perceive that the second frame lacks similarity to the first, their inherent biases lead
them to default to video order, suggesting they rely more on temporal cues than genuine spatial understanding.
RL with spatial puzzles enables the model to extract key features from the first frame and systematically
compare them across multiple frames, allowing it to accurately determine spatial relationships. Lastly, Fig. 12
shows that even with long CoT, the model without Phyiscal AI RL struggles with object permanence, often
confusing itself when reasoning about an object’s appearance and disappearance. In contrast, the RL model
quickly reaches conclusions through direct and concise reasoning.

8. Related Work
8.1. Foundation Models for Physical AI
Early approaches to integrating large pre-trained models into embodied agents primarily relied on using
existing large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) as static modules. For example,
the line of work using LLM as zero-shot task planner (Li et al., 2022; Song et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022;
Ahn et al., 2022) extracts high-level action plans in natural language directly from pre-trained LLMs without
additional fine-tuning, demonstrating the ability of LLMs to generalize across robotic tasks. Similarly, Code as
Policies (Liang et al., 2022) extends the use of LLMs to generate structured code for robotic control. However,
these pre-trained models, especially the VLMs, are not explicitly designed for physical interactions and, therefore,
often lack the physical common sense understanding and result in suboptimal plans and execution.
Another line of work focuses on directly training vision-language-action (VLA) models end-to-end for embodied
agents (Brohan et al., 2023; Driess et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025; Gemini Robotics Team,
2025). They often start with a pre-trained vision-language model and fine-tune the model with robotics
data to generate embodied actions. This approach has shown significant promise in improving generalization
and robustness across robotic tasks. A notable subcategory of these methods introduces hierarchical policy
representations that separate high-level language-driven planning from low-level action execution (Shi et al.,
2025; Li et al., 2025). These system often use a high-level VLM interpret natural language instructions and
generate plans, while low-level VLA execute fine-grained motor control. These hierarchical architectures
improve task and decomposition.

Detect whether the video plays forward or backward with confidence.
A: forward, B: backward

Re spon se Be f or e R L
Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the video plays forward or backward. The video shows
a step-by-step process of mixing pink powder into a white liquid in a green bowl. The key points
shown are the hand holding a blue container, pouring the pink powder into the bowl, and the
camera being static.
Now, the question is about the direction of playback. Since the video shows a process where steps
are performed in a logical sequence-like pouring the powder into the liquid-it's likely that the
video is showing the correct order of events. If it were played backward, the powder would be
disappearing from the bowl into the container, which doesn't make sense in this context. The
actions shown, such as pouring and mixing, are typical of a forward process. The video does not
show any reverse actions or objects moving in the opposite direction. The camera angle is static,
so there's no indication of reverse motion effects. Therefore, the video should be playing
forward.

Re spon se A f t e r R L
Okay, let's break this down. In the sequence of frames provided, the hand holding the container
appears to be pouring a pink powder into a green bucket containing a white powder.
As the sequence progresses, the amount of pink powder in the container increases while the amount
in the bucket decreases. This suggests that the action is being undone, which is characteristic
of a video playing in reverse. Additionally, the hand's motion and the position of the container
change in a way that indicates the action is being retraced, further supporting the idea that the
video is playing backward.
The text on the screen remains constant throughout the frames, indicating that the content of the
video is not changing, but rather the action being performed is being undone.
The text on the screen remains constant throughout the frames, indicating that the content of the
video is not changing, but rather the action being performed is being undone.

Figure 10: While the model before RL struggles to understand and associate perception with reverse actions,
RL enables the model to reason through time while avoiding distractions, such as stationary text.

Cosmos-Reason1: From Physical Common Sense To Embodied Reasoning

Recent efforts have sought to enable embodied AI with stronger reasoning abilities. One such approach is
the embodied chain-of-thought (CoT) framework (Zawalski et al., 2024), which enables robotic agents to
reason through sequential decisions before executing actions. This aligns with broader trends in AI where
explicit reasoning mechanisms improve interpretability and adaptability. Similarly, Liu et al. (2023); Elhafsi
et al. (2023) introduce methods that perform step-by-step reasoning for explaining and correcting failures.
While these methods advance the cognitive capabilities of embodied AI, most still rely on manual prompting to
structure their reasoning processes, limiting their autonomous adaptation and generalization. CoT-VLA (Zhao
et al., 2025) introduces a CoT process which first predicts a future image and then predicts the action which
should interact with the environment to achieve the predicted future image.
Beyond robotics, VLA models have been applied to other physical embodiments, such as autonomous driving.
For example, CoVLA (Arai et al., 2024) introduces a large-scale vision-language-action dataset specifically for
self-driving applications, facilitating research into multimodal decision-making in autonomous systems.

8.2. Vision Language Models
The community has made significant strides in building vision language models. Prominent families of models
include Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022), LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023), InternVL (Chen et al., 2024), QwenVL (Bai
et al., 2025), NVLM (Dai et al., 2024), Llama-3.2-Vision (Grattafiori et al., 2024). These vision language
models typically adopt one of two common architectures: the decoder-only architecture, as seen in models like
LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023) and InternVL (Chen et al., 2024), which integrates image tokens within the LLM’s selfattention layers, and the cross-attention-based architecture, exemplified by Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022) and
Llama-3.2-Vision (Grattafiori et al., 2024), where image tokens are processed through the LLM’s cross-attention
layers. Dai et al. (2024) compares both architectures in a state-of-the-art setting and finds that the decoderonly architecture exhibits stronger reasoning capabilities in college-level multidisciplinary knowledge and
mathematical reasoning tasks within a visual context. Building on this, we adopt the decoder-only architecture
to develop the reasoning model for Physical AI.

8.3. LLMs and VLMs with Reasoning Capabilities
Early studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) exhibit basic reasoning capabilities in mathematics (Cobbe et al., 2021), coding (Chen et al., 2021), and general reasoning tasks. These capabilities can
be further enhanced through chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022). Recently, OpenAI o1 (OpenAI,
2024; Jaech et al., 2024) demonstrated that LLMs’ reasoning capabilities in coding and mathematics can
be significantly enhanced through large-scale reinforcement learning. Notably, the open-sourced DeepSeekR1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025) has shared its training methodology with the community, providing valuable insights
into building high-performance reasoning models. However, existing studies primarily focus on reasoning
tasks related to coding, mathematics, and STEM fields (Liu et al., 2024), even within multimodal reasoning
settings (Qwen-Team, 2024). Recently, there has been a surge of efforts aimed at integrating R1’s reasoning
capabilities into VLMs (Liu et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025; Haonan Wang,
2025). In this work, we explore reasoning capabilities in the context of Physical AI.

9. Conclusion
In this work, we present Cosmos-Reason1, a family of multimodal large-language models specialized in physical
world understanding and reasoning. To specialize the model in Physical AI, we define ontologies to encapsulate
foundational capabilities for Physical AI models and construct supervised fine-tuning data and benchmarks for
common sense and embodied reasoning accordingly. We further explore the idea of Physical AI RL crafting rulebased, verifiable rewards and using reinforcement learning to improve the model’s capabilities with reasoning
about space, time, and intuitive physics. Our experiments show that Physical AI SFT improves the backbone
VLM’s performance by more than 10% on the proposed physical common sense and embodied reasoning
benchmarks. Physical AI RL further boosts accuracy by over 5%. With Physical AI SFT and RL, Cosmos-Reason1

can learn intuitive physics, such as the arrow of time and object permanence, which existing models struggle
with. We will make our code open-source and models open-weight to expedite the progress of building Physical
AI systems that understand and perform complex tasks in the physical world.

A.6. Object Permanence Reasoning Extraction Prompt
Ob j ec t P e r man e nc e Re as on i ng E xt r ac t ion P rom p t
This is a video of a robotic simulation environment. The robotic arm moves and may occlude
objects. The camera moves around the scene and then returns to a position near its initial
location. Occlusion can also occur due to the camera's movement.
The objects in the videos are akita black bowl and akita black bowl and cookies and glazed rim
porcelain ramekin and plate and wooden cabinet and flat stove.
akita black bowl is occluded in the middle of video and then vanishes unexpectedly.
Is there an object that becomes temporarily occluded but does not reappear in the end,
contradicting object permanence?

You are given 32 frames from different contexts. Looking at the first frame, which other frame is most likely to be at
right of the first frame?
A: Frame 2, B: Frame 30, C: Frame 9, D: Frame 11

Re spon se Be f or e R L
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which frame is most likely to be on the right of the first frame based
on the given video description. First, I need to recall the details of each frame. The first frame shown is a close-up of a
shirtless man lifting weights with a barbell overhead. The question is about the spatial relationship between frames,
specifically which frame would be positioned to the right of this first frame.
Looking at the options provided: A is Frame 2, B is Frame 30, C is Frame 9, D is Frame 11. To figure out the correct
answer, I need to check the order of the frames as listed in the video description. The frames are numbered sequentially
from 1 to 32, and each frame's content gives a clue about its position relative to others.
The video starts with Frame 1 (the weightlifter), then moves through various scenes. Let's scan through the order to see
which frame comes after the first one. For example, after Frame 1, the next frame might be Frame 2, which could be the two
women walking in an airport. But the question is about the right side of the first frame, not necessarily the next frame in
the sequence. However, since the frames are shown in order, and the answer options are based on their numerical sequence,
it's likely that the next frame (Frame 2) would be adjacent or in the same general area, especially if the video is
structured as a continuous sequence with adjacent scenes. Looking at the given frames, Frame 2 is the two women in an
airport. If the first frame is the weightlifter, and the next logical scene is the women walking, then Frame 2 would be to
the right. Alternatively, if the sequence jumps around, but given the structure of the video (as per the video), the frames
are presented in order. Therefore, the right adjacent frame would be the next one in sequence, which is Frame 2. Other
options like Frame 30 or 9 or 11 don't immediately follow Frame 1 in the video order.
So the most logical choice based on the sequence provided is Frame 2.

Re spon se A f t e r R L
Okay, let's break this down. To determine which frame is most likely to be to the right of the first frame, we need to
identify frames that share similar characteristics with the first frame. The first frame depicts a shirtless man with long
hair and a beard doing pull-ups in a minimalist room. Key elements include the man's appearance, the pull-up bar, and the
room's simplicity.
We examine the other frames for matching details. Frame 11 shows a shirtless man with curly hair and a beard doing pull-ups
in a room with beige walls and a closed door. This closely matches the first frame, particularly the man's appearance and
the room's features. Both frames involve pull-ups and share a minimalist aesthetic.
Other frames do not align as closely. Frame 4 shows a child on a chair, which is unrelated. Frame 17 features a kitchen,
which is a different setting. Frame 14 shows a person in a kitchen, also unrelated. Frame 24 depicts a snowy landscape,
which is entirely different. Given the similarities between Frame 1 and Frame 11, it is reasonable to conclude that Frame
11 is the most likely candidate to be to the right of the first frame. Both frames depict the same man performing pull-ups
in a similar setting, making them strong candidates for being part of the same image.
Therefore, the correct answer is

Frame 11.

Figure 11: While the model before RL mistakenly associates spatial questions with temporal reasoning, RL
enables the model to identify key features of the first frame and compare them with subsequent frames.

I n t u i t i v e P h ys ic s : Ob j ec t P e r man e nc e

This is a video of a robotic simulation environment. The robotic arm moves and may occlude objects. The camera moves around
the scene and then returns to a position near its initial location. Occlusion can also occur due to the camera's movement.
Is there an object that becomes temporarily occluded but does not reappear in the end, contradicting object permanence?
A: Yes, B: No

Re spon se Be f or e R L
Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether there's an object that gets temporarily hidden (occluded) but
doesn't come back, which would challenge the idea of object permanence. First, I need to recall what the video shows. The
setup has a robotic arm moving around three silver plates and a red plate. The camera moves around the scene and then goes
back to its original spot. The key points here are about occlusion and object permanence. Object permanence is the concept
that objects continue to exist even when they're not visible. So if something is occluded (temporarily hidden) but
reappears later, that's consistent with object permanence. But if it's occluded and doesn't come back, that would
contradict it.
Looking at the actions: the robotic arm picks up a silver plate and moves it towards the red plate. The camera moves
around, possibly showing parts of the scene from different angles. The video shows that the camera returns to its original
position. So when the arm moves the plate, the camera's movement might cause temporary occlusion (like when the arm is
between the camera and the plate), but once the camera moves back, the plate should still be there. However, the question
is about whether the object comes back after being occluded.
The video ends with the arm moving the plate towards the red plate. The camera returning to its initial position might mean
that the arm's action of moving the plate is completed, but does the plate reappear? Since the arm is moving the plate,
once it's moved, the plate is no longer in its original position. But object permanence isn't about the object's location
changing; it's about whether the object is lost from view entirely and not found again. If the camera's movement causes
temporary occlusion (like the arm blocking the plate from view), but when the camera moves back, the plate is still there
(just not in view), then that's okay. The plate doesn't vanish and reappear; it's just not visible at a moment.
The key here is that the plate was moved by the arm. If during the camera's movement, the arm's action caused the plate to
be occluded (like moving it out of view), but once the camera returns, the plate is no longer in the camera's frame but
still exists elsewhere. However, since the camera returns to its original position, and the arm has moved the plate, the
plate might not reappear in the camera's view again. But does that count as the object coming back? If the arm has moved it
out of the scene entirely, then it's gone, which would contradict object permanence. But if it's just moved to another part
of the table and the camera's original position doesn't show it again, but the plate is still there somewhere else, that's
fine.
Wait, the question says "occluded but does not reappear in the end" So if the plate is moved by the arm and then the
camera's movement doesn't show it again, but the plate is still in the video (like on the table but not in the camera's
current view), then it's still there. So the plate didn't vanish, just not in view. So object permanence holds because the
object still exists, even if not seen. Therefore, the answer would be "No", because even if occluded temporarily, the
object remains present and would reappear if the camera or arm moves back. The plate is moved but still exists in the
video, just not in the camera's current view. So temporary occlusion doesn't contradict object permanence. Therefore, the
answer is B.

Re spon se A f t e r R L
Okay, let's break this down. The question is asking if there's an object that becomes temporarily occluded ( meaning hidden
from view for a bit ) but then doesn't reappear, which would contradict the idea of object permanence. Object permanence is
the concept that objects exist even when not seen, so if something disappears and doesn't come back, that's a problem.
Looking at the video: The akita black bowl is shown as being occluded in the middle of the video and then vanishes
unexpectedly. The key points here are that it's occluded (so temporarily hidden) and then it disappears. The question is
whether the disappearance contradicts object permanence.
Object permanence would mean that even if something is hidden, it should still exist. But in the video, the bowl vanishes
unexpectedly. So if it's no longer there, that would mean it's gone, which would contradict object permanence. But wait,
maybe the bowl was moved out of the camera's view, but the video shows vanishes unexpectedly, implying it's not just moving
out of the camera but actually disappearing.
So the answer would be A, yes, because the bowl disappears and doesn't reappear, which would contradict object permanence.
The other objects like the plates and cabinet are shown as remaining, so only the bowl is the one that disappears.
Therefore, the correct answer is A.

Figure 12: While the model before RL fails to reason about object permanence through long CoT, RL enables
the model to correctly infer that the object’s disappearance is not due to camera movement, using concise and
direct reasoning.
